I am a data science student with a strong background in tools such as Tableau, Power BI, advanced Excel, Python, and SQL. I have a passion for using data to drive business decisions and solve real-world problems. In my studies and projects, I have gained experience in data wrangling, visualization, and analysis, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a data professional.
